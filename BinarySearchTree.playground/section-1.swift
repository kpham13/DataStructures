//////////////////////////////////////////
// Data Structures - Binary Search Tree //
//////////////////////////////////////////

// Hierarchical structure with root node, subtrees, and children/leaf nodes.
// Ordered or sorted binary tree (specialized type of tree, where each node has at most two children.
// The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
// The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
// The left and right subtree each must be a binary search tree.
// Each node can have up to two successor nodes.
// There must be no duplicate nodes.
// A unique path exists from the root to every other node.
